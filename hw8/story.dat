     "Let's go *verb* in the *nouns*!" said Avery.
     The *nounp* *verbp* to the *nouns*.
     Mr. Zuckerman had the *adj* *nouns* in the country. It was a *adj* *adj*
*nouns* tied to *nouns* over the north doorway. At the *adj* end of the *nouns*
was a *adj* *nouns* to sit on. It was arranged so that you could swing without
being *verbp*. You *verbp* a *nouns* to the *nouns*. Then, *verb* the *nouns*,
you stood at the edge and *verbp* down, and were *adj* and *adj*. Then you
*verbp* the knot, so that it acted as a *nouns*. Then you got up all your
nerve, *verbp* a deep *nouns*, and *verbp*. For a second you seemed to be *verb* to
the *nouns* far below, but then suddenly the *nouns* would begin to catch you,
and you would be *verbp* through the *nouns* *verb* a mile a minute, with
the *nouns* *verb* in your eyes and ears and *nouns*.  Then you would be *verb*
upward into the sky, and be *verb* up at the *nounp*, and the *nouns* would
twist and you would be *verb* and *verb* with the *nouns*.  Then you would be
*verb* down, down, down out of the *nouns* and come *verb* into the *nouns*
almost into the *nouns*, then sail out again (not quite so far this time), then
in again (not quite so *adj* ), then out again, then in again, then out, then
in; and then you'd be *verb* off and fall down and let *nouns* try it.
